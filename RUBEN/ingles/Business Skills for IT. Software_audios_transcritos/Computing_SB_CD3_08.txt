Page 46, Exercise 2.
Listen to the many dialogues between a business customer and a software developer
and fill in the missing words.
Which questions are asked by the customer and which by the developer?
1.
What do you need the software to do for your company?
I need a program that will help me manage the cash flow, analyze sales,
and improve my accounting efficiency.
2.
How can I try a demo of the software?
You can download a trial version of the software and try it for 30 days.
This allows you to familiarize yourself with the programs and see how some of the key functions work.
3.
Is that software package very expensive?
It isn't cheap, but you can buy the basic package now and purchase add-on modules later for an additional fee.
4.
Are you looking to integrate this program with any other software?
Yes, I need a program designed by an established company so that it will easily combine with other software packages in the future.
5.
Will it be difficult for me to move information from my existing software to a new program?
Not really.
The information can be transferred overnight and you will be able to use the new software in the morning.
6.
What support or maintenance can you offer me for this software?
We provide a long list of FAQs on our website or you can email us.
Once you purchase the software, you can call our 24-hour help desk for assistance.
