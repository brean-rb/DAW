Copy the work schedule into your notebook. Then listen to a conversation between an
administrative assistant and her employer. Then complete the administrative assistant's
work schedule.
Good morning Mr. Watson. You wanted to see me?
Yes, Paula. Please sit down. I'd like to discuss the next couple of days with you.
We're going to be very busy because of the software conference on Wednesday. This morning,
I want you to work with Janet on her presentation for the conference.
She's already designed the presentation.
Yes, I know. But if she improves the layout and embed some short videos into it, it will
be much more interesting.
Okay.
This afternoon, please send reminders to all our customers about the conference.
Right, Mr. Watson.
First thing tomorrow morning, could you organize my correspondence, please? You need
to sort my emails into folders. If there are any problems, you can call me.
Sure. Have you had a chance to look at the brochure designs for the conference?
Yes, I have. And I've told Sam my personal preference.
Tomorrow at 4, you've got a meeting with accounting.
Yes, I know. Could we meet before that, say at 3 o'clock? I'd like us to look together
at my report and the spreadsheets before the meeting.
Yes, of course. Is that all, Mr. Watson?
Yes. But don't forget you need to be at the conference on Wednesday at 9.30 to greet
our guests.
Thanks very much, Paula.
