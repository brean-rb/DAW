Page 74, Exercise 2
An IT security advisor, A, is giving security advice to a business owner, B.
Number sections A to C in the correct order to form a dialogue.
Then listen to the dialogue and check your answers.
Hi, Matthew. What seems to be the problem?
Well, Jack, last month we had a serious security breach even though we had installed new antivirus software.
When did you last download an update?
Oh, I'm not sure.
You need to check for software updates at least once a month.
OK, I'll get the IT staff to check that.
Is there anything else that you're concerned about?
Yes, some employees have complained that sometimes they can't access all the programs they need.
It sounds like we need to reassess the firewall settings.
I'll adjust the settings for you.
Have you got any other questions?
Yes. How else can we make sure our network is completely secure?
You should consider installing a VPN, a virtual private network.
It offers a much better level of security.
How does that work?
It works as a private network, even though you are using a public network.
