Two colleagues are discussing internet security.
Choose a correct answer.
Then listen to the dialogue and check your answers.
Hi, Katie.
My daughter was surfing the web last night
and I noticed some undesirable content
that I didn't want her to see.
I need to block certain websites.
Do you know how I can do this?
It's easy, Wendy.
You can set up your PC to monitor what your children are viewing.
It will also keep them away from certain games and sites.
You can even set limits on how much time they spend online.
You mean I can actually limit what sites the browser finds?
Sure.
Almost all browsers and social media websites
have parental controls or privacy settings.
Where do I find the parental controls on Google?
How do I set them?
In your browser, go to search settings
on the right-hand side of the screen.
Under safe search filters,
check the box next to turn on safe search.
Then at the bottom of the page,
click save.
How does this help?
When someone does a search in their browser,
this filters the search results
and eliminates undesirable videos and websites.
Is it completely safe?
It's not 100% accurate.
However, it helps protect children
for most of the inappropriate search results.
