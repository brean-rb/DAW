How to stay safe online.
With more and more people completing transactions online,
digital safety has become an important factor.
Today, more than ever, you must take precautions to ensure your personal information is safe from hackers and thieves.
1. Password protection.
Never share your passwords with anyone or include them in emails.
Password protect all sensitive files on your computer.
Use a sentence that is at least 12 characters long to create a strong password.
2. Social media.
Protect against identity theft.
Don't make your personal information public.
Adjust your privacy settings to limit who can see your profile.
If you don't want to risk everyone seeing your photos, don't post them online at all.
Don't make your holiday plans and live photos public.
Thieves will know when your house is empty.
3. Email.
Don't open, click on a link, or reply to an email if you don't know who sent it to you.
Use filters to block unwanted emails such as 1. Fishing.
Fake or fraudulent emails to trick users into sharing their personal information, like credit cards, details,
usernames and passwords.
2. Bulk emails.
Emails sent to millions of people.
They may contain links or downloads with viruses or spyware which can corrupt your computer.
4. Safety for children.
Use parental control options to block undesirable websites, videos and content.
Monitor your children's use of social media and browsing.
Instruct young children and teens about online safety.
Teach them not to make friends with everyone.
People may hide behind a false identity.
