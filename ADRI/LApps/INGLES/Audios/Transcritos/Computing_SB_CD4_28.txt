Listen to the conversation between a bank employee and a client.

Hello, this is Dorothy Myers.
Who am I speaking to?
Hello, Mrs. Myers.
This is Philip Clark.
I'm the customer relations officer at the bank.
I think I've got a problem, Mr. Clark.
This morning I got an email from the bank asking me to confirm my password
by filling in a form on the email and sending it back.
I was a bit surprised because the bank only asks for my password
when I log into your website.
The other thing that seemed to be suspicious was the logo.
I checked it against some other correspondence that I've had from you
and it looks fraudulent.
Yes, it's a scam.
We've received a number of calls this morning about this phishing.
It seems that a bulk email has gone out to some of our clients.
At the moment, we are monitoring all outgoing transactions
and sending notification of the risk to all our clients.
Does this mean that thieves are trying to get into my account?
Yes, they could be.
Is there anything I can do to ensure this doesn't happen again?
Yes. First, delete the email immediately.
Don't reply.
Then adjust your filters to block any further emails from this undesirable sender.
Don't put your password on any document
except the bank's website protected sign-in page.
I will. Thanks, Mr. Clark. I'm so pleased I called you.
