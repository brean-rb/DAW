Two IT Managers
From Sam Brown Network Administrator
Subject Company Cybersecurity Meeting
Following last week's cyber attack attempts, we all need to reassess security to protect our business
Please read the agenda points below before our meeting
It is essential that all managers attend
1. Establish Better Network Security
Buy new antivirus software with real-time protection to make sure we are better protected against viruses,
spyware and other malicious codes. Check which new vendors regularly provide patches and updates to their software
2. Secure our network
Check the firewall and encrypting information. Make sure the Wi-Fi is secure and hidden.
To safeguard from unauthorized access, implement password protection on the router.
3. Establish Stronger Security Policy for All Employees
Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for employees to gain entry to sensitive data.
Administrative privileges should be limited to IT managers only.
Make sure all employees are aware of the penalties if they violate the business's cybersecurity rules.
4. Research New Backup System
Install a more innovative program to perform daily backup which also includes an effective recovery
solution. An alternative backup for storing copies of site or on the cloud is also essential.
5. Redesign Policy on Payments
Check our authentication system with the bank and credit card companies
before we open our e-commerce site. It is imperative we use the most trusted validation tools and
anti-fraud services.
